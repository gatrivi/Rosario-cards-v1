# Visual Progress Feedback - October 18, 2025

## Overview

Added real-time visual feedback to help users track their progress through the rosary by highlighting completed beads and the next bead to press.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Next Bead Gentle Glow** âœ¨
The next bead you should press now has a gentle, pulsing **gold glow** that helps guide you through the rosary sequence.

**Visual Properties:**
- **Color**: Gold (rgba(255, 215, 0))
- **Effect**: Gentle pulse animation (0.3 to 0.6 opacity)
- **Shadow**: 12-14px blur with pulsing size
- **Ring**: 4-5.5px outside bead edge
- **Animation**: Sine wave at 800ms period (slow, calm pulse)

**When It Appears:**
- Shows on the bead at `currentPrayerIndex + 1`
- Only displays if there's a next bead in the sequence
- Updates automatically as you progress through prayers

### 2. **Completed Beads Silver Aura** ðŸŒŸ
Beads you've already pressed and recited now retain a soft **silver aura** so you can see your progress at a glance.

**Visual Properties:**
- **Color**: Silver (rgba(192, 192, 192, 0.5))
- **Shadow**: 8px blur with 0.6 opacity
- **Ring**: 2px wide, 2px outside bead edge
- **Style**: Steady glow (no animation)

**What It Tracks:**
- Uses the `pressedBeads` Set from `useRosaryState`
- Only counts actual bead presses (not chain prayers like Gloria/Fatima)
- Persists throughout the current rosary session
- Resets when mystery changes or rosary restarts

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

#### 1. `src/App.js`
**Changes:**
- Added `pressedBeads` to destructured values from `useRosaryState` (line 236)
- Passed `pressedBeads` prop to `InteractiveRosary` component (line 690)

```javascript
const {
  // ... other values
  pressedBeads,
  getPressedBeadCount,
  markBeadPressed,
  // ...
} = useRosaryState(RosarioPrayerBook, currentMystery);

<InteractiveRosary
  // ... other props
  pressedBeads={pressedBeads}
/>
```

#### 2. `src/components/RosarioNube/InteractiveRosary.jsx`
**Changes:**
- Added `pressedBeads` prop to component signature (line 24)
- Added silver aura rendering for completed beads (lines 1393-1409)
- Added gold glow rendering for next bead (lines 1411-1436)

**Rendering Logic:**
```javascript
// Silver aura for pressed beads
if (bead.prayerIndex !== undefined && pressedBeads.has(bead.prayerIndex)) {
  context.strokeStyle = "rgba(192, 192, 192, 0.5)";
  context.lineWidth = 2;
  context.shadowColor = "rgba(192, 192, 192, 0.6)";
  context.shadowBlur = 8;
  // ... draw arc
}

// Gold glow for next bead
const nextBeadIndex = currentPrayerIndexRef.current + 1;
if (bead.prayerIndex === nextBeadIndex && nextBeadIndex < rosarySequence.length) {
  const pulseAlpha = Math.abs(Math.sin(Date.now() / 800)) * 0.3 + 0.3;
  const pulseSize = Math.abs(Math.sin(Date.now() / 800)) * 1.5;
  context.strokeStyle = `rgba(255, 215, 0, ${pulseAlpha})`;
  // ... draw pulsing arc
}
```

## Visual Hierarchy

The rendering order ensures proper visual layering:

1. **Base completed outline** (faint, for all beads before current)
2. **Silver aura** (for pressed beads)
3. **Gold glow** (for next bead)
4. **Current bead highlight** (bright, for active prayer)
5. **Chain prayer indicator** (animated outline for multi-press)
6. **Blinking effect** (for next bead after chain prayers)

## User Experience

### Before This Feature
- Users had to rely on the progress bar or prayer text to know where they were
- No visual indication of which bead to press next
- No way to see which beads had been completed at a glance

### After This Feature
âœ… **Next bead glows gold** â†’ Clear guidance on what to press next  
âœ… **Completed beads have silver aura** â†’ Visual confirmation of progress  
âœ… **Gentle animations** â†’ Calming, meditative aesthetic  
âœ… **Works with existing features** â†’ Chain prayers, litany, developer mode all compatible  

## Animation Performance

**Optimization Considerations:**
- Uses `Date.now()` for smooth animation independent of frame rate
- Sine wave calculations are efficient (no heavy trig operations)
- Shadow effects are GPU-accelerated on modern browsers
- Canvas rendering is already optimized with Matter.js render loop

**Target**: 60 FPS maintained with all visual effects active

## Testing Scenarios

âœ… Click any bead â†’ Next bead immediately glows gold  
âœ… Complete a bead â†’ Silver aura appears and persists  
âœ… Progress through decade â†’ Trail of silver beads follows you  
âœ… Change mystery â†’ Silver auras reset (new session)  
âœ… Chain prayers â†’ Next bead glows after Gloria/Fatima complete  
âœ… Litany mode â†’ Heart bead gets gold glow when active  
âœ… Developer mode â†’ All visual effects still visible with prayer indices  

## Design Rationale

### Color Choices
- **Gold for "next"**: Warm, inviting color that draws attention without being harsh
- **Silver for "completed"**: Cool, subtle color that shows progress without distraction

### Animation Speed
- **800ms period**: Slow enough to be calming, fast enough to be noticeable
- **0.3-0.6 opacity range**: Visible but not overpowering

### Visual Balance
- Next bead glow is slightly more prominent than completed aura
- Completed beads are subtle so they don't compete with current prayer
- All effects respect the meditative nature of prayer

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- [ ] Make glow colors customizable in settings
- [ ] Add option to toggle visual feedback on/off
- [ ] Different colors per mystery type (e.g., blue for Joyful, red for Sorrowful)
- [ ] Sound effect when bead completes and silver aura appears

## Git Commit

**Commit**: `0832b11` - Add visual progress feedback: Next bead glows gold, completed beads have silver aura

**Files Changed:**
- `src/App.js` (2 lines added)
- `src/components/RosarioNube/InteractiveRosary.jsx` (46 lines added)

## Notes

This feature complements the existing bead progress tracking system and provides immediate visual feedback that enhances the sequential bead-pressing experience. Users now have three ways to track progress:

1. **Progress bar** (top of screen) - Overall completion percentage
2. **Silver auras** (on beads) - Which specific beads have been pressed
3. **Gold glow** (next bead) - Where to go next

The combination creates a clear, intuitive navigation system that feels natural when praying the rosary.
