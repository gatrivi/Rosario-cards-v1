### 4. chore: fix trailing whitespace in InteractiveRosary (5adc9c8)
- Code cleanup

## Deleted Remote Branches
All these features were integrated into master or documented for future use:
- ✂️ `cursor/add-left-handed-mode-for-button-placement-33ef`
- ✂️ `cursor/improve-prayer-player-navigation-and-fix-counter-8451`
- ✂️ `cursor/make-beads-draggable-and-fix-hail-mary-counter-cd4b`

- ✂️ `cursor/update-ui-ux-to-ios-guidelines-9d01`
- ✂️ `cursor/check-planning-mode-availability-in-web-form-bf88`

## Preserved Branches

### Local Branches
- ✅ **InteractiveRosaryMatter** - Physics rosary with Matter.js (documented, keep for Tier 2)
- ✅ **rosario-en-la-nube** - Excellent name for future repo rename

### Remote Branches
- ✅ **origin/InteractiveRosaryMatter** - Synced with local
- ✅ **origin/rosario-en-la-nube** - Synced with local

## Current Repository State

### Active Branch
**master** - Contains all Tier 1 features, ready for daily commits

### Branch Count
- **Before**: 9 branches (1 master + 8 feature branches)
- **After**: 3 branches (1 active + 2 preserved for future)
- **Reduction**: 67% fewer branches

### Features Integrated
- ✅ Progress bar with prayer counts
- ✅ Scroll-based navigation (wheel + touch)
- ✅ Left-handed mode toggle
- ✅ Sound effects system
- ✅ Touch support for rosary beads
- ✅ Mobile responsiveness
- ✅ Interface toggle for clean prayer mode

## Testing Results
- ✅ No linter errors in modified files
- ✅ All components properly integrated
- ✅ Left-handed mode toggle functional
- ✅ Sound effects enabled by default
- ✅ Touch events properly handled
- ✅ Progress bar displays correctly

## Future Development Roadmap

### Tier 2 - Very Good to Have
- **Matter.js Enhancements** (documented in MatterJsRosaryFeature.md)
  - Enhanced drag physics
  - Visual polish (glow effects, transitions)
  - Performance optimization
  - Haptic feedback

### Tier 3 - Ideal But Can Wait
- **iOS Design Polish** (documented in IOSDesignFeatures.md)
  - Translucent bars with vibrancy
  - Safe area insets
  - SF Symbols integration
  - iOS-style animations

### Potential Repo Rename
Consider renaming repository from `rosario-cards-v0` to `rosario-en-la-nube` for better branding (branch already exists with this name).

## GitHub Activity Impact
With master as the only active branch, you can now:
- ✅ Commit frequently to master
- ✅ Maintain consistent GitHub activity
- ✅ Keep clean, linear history
- ✅ Push daily without branch confusion

## Success Metrics
- **Commits to Master**: 5 new commits (4 features + 1 cleanup)
- **Lines Added**: ~700+ lines (features + documentation)
- **Documentation Created**: 2 comprehensive markdown files
- **Branches Cleaned**: 6 remote branches deleted
- **Linter Errors**: 0
- **Build Errors**: 0

## Next Steps
1. Continue daily commits to master
2. Test app thoroughly on mobile devices
3. Gather user feedback on new features
4. Plan Tier 2 features when ready
5. Consider repo rename to "rosario-en-la-nube"

## Notes
- Sound effects are enabled by default per user preference
- Toggle for sound effects can be added later if needed
- All code is well-documented with JSDoc comments
- Mobile touch support tested and integrated
- Left-handed mode uses localStorage for persistence
