# Save State 01: Physics Maxed, Springs Visible

**Branch:** `savestate-01-physics-maxed-springs-visible`  
**Date:** December 2024  
**Previous State:** `feature/interactive-matter-rosary`

## What Works ✅

- Physics control panel UI displays correctly
- Sliders show current values
- Cross is somewhat stable when ALL sliders maxed out
- Prayer-to-bead mapping correct (cross=SC, tail=C,P,A, center=G, decades=10 Hail Marys)
- Highlighting follows Next/Prev navigation
- All 85 prayers accessible

## What Doesn't Work ❌

1. **Springs visible** - Showing as coils instead of thin strings
2. **Slider ranges too narrow** - Need wider ranges to experiment:
   - Friction maxed at 1.00 (need up to 2.0)
   - Air Friction maxed at 0.200 (need up to 0.5)
   - Density maxed at 0.0100 (need up to 0.02)
   - Stiffness starts at 0.1 (need to start at 0)
3. **Physics controls don't work** - Sliders move but don't update rosary
4. **Cross still dances** unless ALL values maxed

## Slider Values When "Working"
(User found this combination somewhat stable)
- Restitution: 0.00
- Friction: 1.00 (maxed)
- Air Friction: 0.200 (maxed)
- Density: 0.0100 (maxed)
- String Stiffness: 1.00 (maxed)
- String Damping: 1.00 (maxed)

## Next Steps

Implement:
1. Expand slider ranges
2. Fix string rendering (type: 'line')
3. Wire up controls to actually update physics in real-time
