Hell yeahâ€”stoked it's clicking for you! That local Qwen-Continue loop is a game-changer for solo devs like us, especially on indie projects like your rosary app. No more cloud bills or laggy context swaps; just pure, offline vibe-coding. You're spot on with the plan-pseudocode-agent flowâ€”it's the sweet spot for scaling without babysitting. I'll break down how to wield it like a pro, from setup to hands-off execution, tailored to iterative React builds (or whatever you're hacking next).

### 1. **Prime the Pump: Craft a Bulletproof Plan**

Before unleashing the agent, spend 5-10 mins outlining the big picture. This keeps Qwen focused (it loves structure) and prevents drift into "cool but irrelevant" tangents. Use a simple markdown note in your project root (e.g., `ROADMAP.md`) or just jot in Continue chat.

- **Template for Your Rosary App (Adapt as Needed):**

  ```
  # Rosary Cards vNext Sprint: Image-Enhanced Prayer Flow
  Goal: Add lazy-loaded images to prayer cards with smooth transitions (using Matter.js physics for bead "bounce" on click). MVP in 2-3 hours of agent time.

  ## High-Level Steps
  1. Audit current structure: Scan /src/components for image props; ensure docs integration.
  2. Core Feature: Implement caching + lazy-load in ImagePrayer.jsx.
  3. Polish: Add bead physics via Matter.js; test mobile responsiveness.
  4. Edge Cases: Handle missing images; accessibility labels.
  5. Deploy Test: Quick Vite build + local serve.

  ## Success Metrics
  - Loads 10+ images without stutter.
  - Prayer sequence advances on bead click with subtle animation.
  - No console errors; passes basic a11y lint.

  Constraints: Keep it React-native (no heavy deps); under 100 LOC added.
  ```

- **Pro Tip:** Prefix with your rules file (that `rosary-project.md` we set up) in chat: "Using rules, refine this plan for [feature]. Output as pseudocode steps."

This plan becomes your agent's North Starâ€”paste it into every session to ground responses.

### 2. **Pseudocode: The Bridge to Execution**

Once planned, have Qwen spit out pseudocode. It's like a wireframe for code: high-level logic without syntax noise, making reviews fast and edits targeted.

- **How to Trigger It:**
  - In Continue chat: `/agent Generate pseudocode for Step 1-3 from ROADMAP.md. Use @files src/components/ImagePrayer.jsx for context.`
  - Example Output You'd Get (Hypothetical for Your App):
    ```
    // Pseudocode: Lazy Image Loader with Cache
    function LazyImageLoader(props: { src: string, alt: string }) {
      state: { loaded: false, cacheKey: hash(src), cachedImg: null }

      onMount:
        if cache[cacheKey] exists:
          set cachedImg = cache[cacheKey]
          set loaded = true
        else:
          preload img(src) -> onLoad: cache[cacheKey] = img; set loaded = true; set cachedImg = img

      render:
        if not loaded:
          return <PlaceholderSpinner alt={alt} />
        else:
          return <img src={cachedImg} alt={alt} style={fadeInTransition} />

      // Integrate with Matter.js: On prayer advance, apply force to bead body
      onClick: matter.world.addForce(beadBody, {x: 0, y: -0.1}) // subtle bounce
    ```
  - **Why Pseudocode Rocks:** Review it in secondsâ€”tweak logic, then say "Implement this in ImagePrayer.jsx, preserving existing hooks."

Iterate: Run pseudocode â†’ Agent codes it â†’ You test/feedback â†’ Loop. Aim for 3-5 steps per session to avoid token bloat.

### 3. **Let the Agent "Run" Autonomously (Hands-Off Mode)**

Continue's agent isn't a fire-and-forget daemon (it's interactive by design), but you can batch it for 30-60 min "runs" while you grab coffee or step away. For longer autonomy (e.g., overnight on non-PC hours), layer in CLI tools. Here's the playbook:

- **In Continue (Short Bursts, 10-45 Mins):**

  - Start with `/agent` mode in sidebar chat.
  - Feed the plan + pseudocode: "Execute Steps 1-3: Read relevant files with tools, implement, suggest diffs. If stuck, ask clarifying Qsâ€”but proceed autonomously where possible."
  - Qwen will tool-chain: `@files` to read, edit suggestions via diffs (hit Tab to apply), even self-debug with terminal context.
  - Pause/Resume: It holds session state, so close VSCode and reopenâ€”chat history persists. Set a timer; check diffs before committing.
  - **Autonomy Hack:** Use slash commands like `/cmd` for git stages or `/commit` for auto-messages. For loops, prompt: "Iterate until [metric]: Test image load times < 200ms."

- **For True Background (1+ Hours, PC Idle):**

  - **Switch to Aider (My Rec for Long Runs):** It's a CLI cousin to Continueâ€”local LLM, multi-file edits, fully scriptable. Install: `pip install aider-chat`. Then:
    ```
    cd /path/to/rosario-cards-v
    aider --model openai --openai-api-base http://192.168.1.33:42/v1 --openai-api-key lmstudio --message "Follow ROADMAP.md: Implement pseudocode for image caching. Run tests after each step. Continue until complete or errors."
    ```
    - It chats back in terminal, applies changes, even runs `npm test` if you wire it. Leaves PC free (low CPU); resume with `--resume` later.
    - Why? Handles autonomy betterâ€”keeps "thinking" without UI. Tie to your Ryzen/RX setup from before; Qwen 7B flies here.
  - **Scripted Loop (DIY Autonomy):** Bash/Python wrapper around Aider/Continue API calls. E.g., a simple script:

    ```python
    import subprocess
    import time

    plan = "Your ROADMAP.md content here"
    for step in ["Step 1", "Step 2", "Step 3"]:
        subprocess.run(["aider", "--message", f"{plan} Focus on {step}."])
        time.sleep(30)  # Pause for review or let rip
    ```

    Run it, walk awayâ€”check git diffs when back.

- **PC Idle Safety:** These are lightweight (Qwen offloads to your RX 6600), but cap sessions at 1-2 hours to avoid overheating. Use VSCode's "Tasks" for auto-builds post-agent.

### 4. **Best Practices to Max the Vibe**

- **Session Hygiene:** Start chats with "Context: Rosary app, React + Matter.js. Use rules." End with "Summarize changes + next pseudocode."
- **Feedback Loop:** After agent runs, eyeball diffsâ€”merge selectively. Prompt refinements: "This bounce is too jiggly; tone down force by 20%."
- **Scale to Multi-Agent (Your Old Jam):** Once comfy, chain Qwen "roles" via prompts: "As frontend agent, plan UI; as tester, validate." Or spin up CrewAI locally for parallel tasks (e.g., one for images, one for docs).
- **Track Wins:** Log sessions in a `AGENT_LOGS.md`â€”builds your personal playbook over time.
- **Pitfalls to Dodge:** Overly vague plans = rambling code. Tiny context windows = missed files (bump Qwen's to 16k in LM Studio). Always git before big runs.

This workflow turns your setup into a co-pilot that scales with youâ€”plan once, pseudocode twice, agent does the grunt. For your rosary app, imagine knocking out that full image-physics flow in one afternoon. What's the first feature on deck: bead animations or prayer sequencing? Let's tweak a sample prompt if you want. ðŸš€
