## 🕊️ Peaceful Visual Refinements (NEW!)

All visual feedback refined for meditative, calming experience:

1. **Focus Hierarchy**: Current bead is now PRIMARY FOCUS (60-100% opacity)
2. **Subtle Orientation**: Next bead is barely visible hint (10-25% opacity)
3. **Gentle Memory**: Completed beads retain 10% silver aura
4. **Slow Transitions**: Rosary fades in/out slowly (1.0-1.2s, not 0.2-0.3s)
5. **Peaceful Animations**: All glows use slow sine waves (1200-1800ms periods)
6. **Cross→Tail**: Next section automatically glows when cross ends

> **Philosophy**: "Focus on the present moment, with gentle awareness of past and future."
