# Quick Reference - New Rosary Navigation

## 🎯 Basic Interaction Pattern

**Sequential Bead Pressing** (like a real rosary):
```
Press beads in order → Each bead shows its prayer → Move to next bead
```

## 🔗 Chain Prayers (New!)

When you reach prayers with chain components (Gloria + Fatima):

### At the 10th Hail Mary:
1. **Press** → 10th Hail Mary
2. **Press again** → Gloria (soft chime ✨)
3. **Press again** → Fatima (soft chime ✨)  
4. **Press again** → Ready chime 🔔 + next bead blinks
5. Press the blinking bead to continue

### At Mystery Beads (lone beads):
1. **Press** → Mystery meditation
2. **Press again** → Our Father (chime ✨)
3. Next bead blinks → continue

**Visual Cue**: Active bead with chain prayers shows a rotating dashed ring

## 📜 Scroll Through Text (Analog Controller)

**Hold any bead and move it:**
- Drag to **TOP** of screen → Scroll text UP ⬆️
- Hold in **MIDDLE** → No scrolling (neutral)
- Drag to **BOTTOM** → Scroll text DOWN ⬇️

**Zones:**
- Top 45% = Scroll up
- Middle 10% = Neutral
- Bottom 45% = Scroll down

## ❤️ Heart Bead (Litany Navigation)

**During Litany of Loreto only:**
- Heart bead pulses with gold outline
- **Press repeatedly** to advance through verses
- Each press = one verse forward
- Hear soft chime on each press

## 📊 Progress Tracking

**Top bar shows:** "Beads: 23/60 (38%)"
- Counts unique beads you've pressed
- Excludes chain prayers (Gloria/Fatima)
- 60 beads total in a complete rosary
- Bar fills as you pray

## 🔊 Sound Guide

Listen for these distinct sounds:

| Sound | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Soft high chime ✨ | Chain prayer (Gloria/Fatima) |
| Descending tone 🔔 | Ready to move to next bead |
| Gentle tap | Litany verse progression |
| Standard chime | Normal prayer change |

Sounds are mystery-specific (different frequencies for each mystery type)

## 🎨 Visual Indicators

| Visual | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Gold outline | Current active prayer |
| Silver outline | First touch (preview) |
| Rotating dashed ring | Press again for chain prayers |
| Blinking silver | Next bead is ready |
| Pulsing gold (heart) | Press for litany verses |
| Silver chain glow | Chain prayers active |

## 🎮 Pro Tips

1. **Time your presses**: Wait 500ms between presses (don't spam-click)
2. **Watch for animations**: Visual cues guide you to the next action
3. **Listen to sounds**: Different chimes = different actions
4. **Hold to scroll**: Don't just drag—hold the bead while moving
5. **Sequential navigation**: Follow the rosary structure like in real life

## 🔧 Keyboard Shortcuts (Still Work!)

- `←` / `→` = Navigate prayers
- `Space` = Next prayer
- `F` = Toggle focus mode
- Arrow keys work in litany too

## 📱 Mobile Gestures

- **Tap once** = Preview/select bead
- **Tap twice** = Activate bead
- **Tap 3+ times** = Navigate chain prayers or scroll text
- **Hold & drag** = Scroll text via analog controller
- **Swipe left/right** = Navigate prayers (backup method)

**Remember**: The rosary now works like a real rosary—press beads sequentially and listen/watch for cues! 🙏
