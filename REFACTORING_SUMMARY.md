# InteractiveRosary Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully broke down the large `InteractiveRosary.jsx` file (1000+ lines) into smaller, more maintainable components and hooks.

## Created Files

### Utilities
1. **`utils/mysteryColors.js`**
   - Extracted mystery color scheme logic
   - Returns color objects for each mystery type (gozosos, dolorosos, gloriosos, luminosos)

### Custom Hooks
1. **`hooks/useRosarySequence.js`**
   - Manages rosary prayer sequence based on current mystery
   - Converts mystery names to prayer array keys

2. **`hooks/useRosaryPosition.js`**
   - Manages rosary position state with localStorage persistence
   - Handles drag state (isDragging, dragStart)
   - Listens for position reset events

3. **`hooks/useRosaryDragging.js`**
   - Handles all mouse and touch event handlers for dragging
   - Manages drag constraints (screen bounds)
   - Detects tap vs drag gestures

4. **`hooks/useBeadInteraction.js`**
   - Manages bead interaction state (touched, enhanced, blinking)
   - Handles chain prayer navigation
   - Listens for content exhausted and chain prayer events

5. **`hooks/useRosaryState.js`**
   - Manages visibility, developer mode, and zoom state
   - Handles localStorage for zoom
   - Listens for global state change events

## Main Component Improvements

### Before
- 1000+ lines in a single file
- All state and logic mixed together
- Difficult to maintain and test

### After
- Core physics/rendering logic remains in main file (~2100 lines including physics engine code)
- State management extracted to custom hooks
- Utility functions modularized
- Clear separation of concerns
- Event handlers organized by responsibility

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Each hook has a single responsibility
2. **Reusability**: Hooks can be reused in other components if needed
3. **Testability**: Smaller units are easier to test in isolation
4. **Readability**: Clearer code organization and structure
5. **Build Success**: App compiles successfully with no breaking changes
