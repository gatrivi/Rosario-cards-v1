- **App store rejection**: Common for first submissions
  - Mitigation: Thorough guidelines review, beta test, clear documentation

### Medium Risk
- **Low adoption**: Niche market, competitive space
  - Mitigation: Clear unique value proposition, good ASO, community engagement
- **Technical issues on devices**: Physics engine may be resource-intensive
  - Mitigation: Extensive device testing, performance optimization

### Low Risk
- **Negative reviews**: Generally religious apps get positive reception if quality is good
  - Mitigation: Beta testing, quality focus, responsive support

## Conclusion

**Current Assessment**: The app has a strong foundation with unique features and beautiful design. The core functionality is complete and working well.

**Path to Market**: Focus on legal/compliance (2 weeks), mobile packaging (2-3 weeks), and quality assurance (2-3 weeks) for a realistic 2-month timeline to launch.

**Recommended Strategy**:
1. Launch as iOS app first at $3.99 (easier approval, target market)
2. Add Android 2-4 weeks later
3. Keep web version free as marketing/demo
4. Add audio prayers and Via Crucis as free updates to maintain engagement
5. Consider subscription model only if adding significant backend features (social prayer, extensive audio library, etc.)

**Success Factors**:
- Quality over speed - one platform done well beats two platforms done poorly
- Community engagement - religious apps thrive on word-of-mouth
- Continuous improvement - plan for ongoing updates based on user feedback
- Authentic mission - maintain focus on prayer and contemplation, not just profit
