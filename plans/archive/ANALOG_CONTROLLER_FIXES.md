# Analog Controller and UI Fixes

**Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ **Added Auto-Scroll to Analog Controller**

**Problem**: When dragging bead down to expand prayer text, the text didn't scroll automatically to show lower content.

**Solution**: 
- Added auto-scroll functionality that scrolls proportionally to bead position
- When bead is dragged to bottom 50% of screen, text scrolls from 0% to 100%
- Smooth scrolling during drag
- Automatic scroll reset to top when bead is released

**File Modified**: `src/components/ViewPrayers/ViewPrayers.js`

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Auto-scroll text as bead moves down
if (scrollContainerRef.current && beadPositionRatio > 0.5) {
  const scrollRatio = (beadPositionRatio - 0.5) / 0.5; // 0 to 1
  const maxScroll = scrollContainerRef.current.scrollHeight - scrollContainerRef.current.clientHeight;
  const targetScroll = maxScroll * scrollRatio;
  
  scrollContainerRef.current.scrollTo({
    top: targetScroll,
    behavior: 'auto' // Immediate response during drag
  });
}
```

**Test**: 
- Drag any bead downward past 50% screen height
- Prayer text should automatically scroll as bead moves down
- Release bead - text should scroll back to top smoothly

### 2. ✅ **Fixed CornerFadeControls (Eye Buttons)**

**Problem**: Eye buttons in bottom corners didn't work - they were being blocked by z-index issues and opacity conflicts with the new opacity settings.

**Solutions**:

#### A. Fixed Z-Index Conflicts
- Reduced corner fade zone z-index from 20 to 15
- This ensures settings button (z-index: 20) and help button (z-index: 1000) are clickable
- Reduced zone width from 80px to 70px to avoid overlapping with other buttons

**File Modified**: `src/components/common/CornerFadeControls.css`

#### B. Fixed Opacity Restoration
- CornerFadeControls now stores original opacity before fading
- Applies fade to 0.1 opacity
- Restores original opacity values when released
- Works correctly with user-configured opacity settings

**File Modified**: `src/components/common/CornerFadeControls.jsx`

**Implementation**:
```javascript
const handleStart = () => {
  // Store current opacities from computed styles
  const currentTextOpacity = parseFloat(window.getComputedStyle(prayerText).opacity) || 1;
  const currentRosaryOpacity = parseFloat(window.getComputedStyle(rosary).opacity) || 1;
  
  setOriginalOpacities({ text: currentTextOpacity, rosary: currentRosaryOpacity });
  
  // Apply fade
  prayerText.style.opacity = "0.1";
  rosary.style.opacity = "0.1";
};

const handleEnd = () => {
  // Restore original opacities
  prayerText.style.opacity = originalOpacities.text;
  rosary.style.opacity = originalOpacities.rosary;
};
```

**Test**:
- Hold eye icon in bottom-left corner - prayer text and rosary should fade to 10%
- Release - should restore to configured opacity
- Works with any opacity setting from settings panel

### 3. ✅ **Fixed Button Overlap Issues**

**Problem**: Navigation and UI buttons were overlapping or blocking each other.

**Root Causes**:
1. CornerFadeControls zones (80px wide) were covering settings button (at 10px from left)
2. Z-index conflicts between components
3. Touch zones too large

**Solutions**:
1. Reduced corner fade zone width: 80px → 70px
2. Reduced corner fade zone z-index: 20 → 15
3. Added `pointer-events: auto` to ensure touch events work properly

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/common/CornerFadeControls.css`

**Current Z-Index Hierarchy**:
```
Help Button: 1000 (top right)
Navigation Buttons: 1000 (bottom)
Settings Button: 20 (top left)
Corner Fade Zones: 15 (bottom corners)
Interactive Rosary: 10
Prayer Text: 2
```

**Test**:
- All buttons should be clickable/tappable
- No overlapping or blocking
- Eye buttons work in bottom corners
- Settings button works in top left
- Help button works in top right
- Navigation buttons work at bottom

## Technical Details

### Analog Controller with Auto-Scroll

**Feature**: Drag bead down to:
1. Expand prayer text height (50% → 90%)
2. Scroll through prayer text (0% → 100%)
3. Fade navigation buttons (100% → 10%)

**Behavior**:
- **Bead at 50%**: Text height 50%, scroll 0%, nav 100% opacity
- **Bead at 75%**: Text height 75%, scroll 50%, nav 55% opacity
- **Bead at 100%**: Text height 90%, scroll 100%, nav 10% opacity

**Reset on Release**:
- Text height returns to 50%
- Scroll returns to top (smooth animation)
- Navigation buttons return to 100% opacity

   - Smooth scroll reset on drag end

2. **src/components/common/CornerFadeControls.jsx**
   - Store and restore original opacities
   - Fixed interaction with opacity settings

3. **src/components/common/CornerFadeControls.css**
   - Reduced z-index to 15
   - Reduced width to 70px
   - Added pointer-events: auto

## Testing Checklist

### Auto-Scroll Feature
- [ ] Drag bead down past 50% screen height
- [ ] Verify text scrolls automatically
- [ ] Verify scroll is proportional to bead position
- [ ] Release bead - text scrolls back to top smoothly
- [ ] Test with litany (long prayer) to see full scroll range

### Corner Fade Controls
- [ ] Hold left eye button - everything fades to 10%
- [ ] Release - everything returns to configured opacity
- [ ] Hold right eye button - same behavior
- [ ] Test with different opacity settings (30%, 50%, 100%)
- [ ] Verify feedback message appears

### Button Interactions
- [ ] Tap settings button (top left) - opens settings
- [ ] Tap help button (top right) - opens help
- [ ] Tap eye buttons (bottom corners) - fade works
- [ ] Tap navigation buttons (bottom) - navigation works
- [ ] No buttons overlap or block each other

## Performance Notes

- Auto-scroll uses `behavior: 'auto'` during drag for immediate response
- Scroll reset uses `behavior: 'smooth'` for better UX
- Opacity changes use CSS transitions for 60fps performance
- All touch events properly handled with pointer-events
