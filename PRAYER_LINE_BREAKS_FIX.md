# Prayer Line Breaks Fix

## Problem Solved

Prayer texts in `RosarioPrayerBook.js` contained `\n` newline characters for proper formatting, but these were not being rendered as line breaks in the UI. Instead, HTML treated them as regular whitespace, causing all prayers to appear as single-line paragraphs.

## Solution Implemented

Added `whiteSpace: "pre-line"` CSS property to the prayer text paragraph in `ViewPrayers.js` (line 836).

### Technical Details

**File Modified**: `src/components/ViewPrayers/ViewPrayers.js`

**Change**: Added CSS property to preserve newline characters:

```javascript
<p
  style={{
    margin: 0,
    lineHeight: 1.8,
    letterSpacing: "1px",
    textAlign: "center",
    whiteSpace: "pre-line", // ADDED THIS LINE
  }}
>
  {prayer}
</p>
```

### How `whiteSpace: "pre-line"` Works

- ✅ **Preserves newline characters** (`\n`) as actual line breaks
- ✅ **Collapses consecutive spaces/tabs** to keep text clean
- ✅ **Allows text to wrap normally** within the container
- ✅ **Maintains centered text alignment** as intended

## Results

All prayers now display with proper formatting:

- **Credo** shows paragraph breaks between sections
- **Padre Nuestro** shows line breaks between phrases
- **Ave María** shows proper verse structure
- **Gloria** shows proper formatting
- All mystery texts display with correct line breaks
