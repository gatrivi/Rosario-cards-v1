# Interactive Virtual Rosary - Agent Dominic's Implementation

## Overview
This is an interactive virtual rosary implementation using Matter.js physics engine. The rosary features:

- **Physics Simulation**: Realistic bead movement and chain connections using Matter.js
- **Interactive Beads**: Click on any bead to jump to that prayer
- **Visual Highlighting**: Current prayer bead is highlighted in gold
- **Drag Functionality**: Drag the entire rosary around the screen
- **Floating Physics**: Rosary floats reverently without gravity
- **Cross Structure**: 6-square cross as specified
- **Decade Structure**: 5 decades of 10 beads each in circular pattern

## Features Implemented

### 1. Physics Engine Integration
- Matter.js physics simulation with zero gravity
- Realistic bead collisions and chain constraints
- Smooth dragging and movement

### 2. Rosary Structure
- **Cross**: 6 squares arranged in traditional cross pattern
- **Center Bead**: Large connecting bead between cross and decades
- **Decades**: 5 sets of 10 beads arranged in circular pattern
- **Chains**: Spring constraints connecting all elements

### 3. Interactivity
- **Bead Clicking**: Click any bead to jump to that prayer
- **Prayer Integration**: Seamlessly integrated with existing prayer system
- **Mystery Switching**: Rosary updates when mystery type changes
- **Button Integration**: Prayer buttons can jump to specific beads

### 4. Visual Design
- **Highlighting**: Current prayer bead highlighted in gold (#FFD700)
- **Semi-transparent Overlay**: Prayer content has backdrop blur effect
- **Responsive Layout**: Rosary scales with screen size
- **Theme Support**: Works with existing dark/light theme system

## Technical Implementation

### Components Created
1. **InteractiveRosary.jsx**: Main rosary component with Matter.js physics
2. **useRosaryState.js**: Custom hook for managing rosary state
3. **InteractiveRosary.css**: Styling for rosary container

### Key Features
- **Zero Gravity**: `engine.world.gravity.y = 0` for floating effect
- **Mouse Constraints**: Smooth dragging with `MouseConstraint`
- **Bead Highlighting**: Dynamic color changes based on current prayer
- **Prayer Mapping**: Each bead mapped to specific prayer in sequence

### Integration Points
- **App.js**: Main integration with rosary overlay
- **PrayerButtons.jsx**: Button-to-bead navigation
- **ViewPrayers.js**: Semi-transparent prayer display

## Usage
1. The rosary appears on launch and floats in the background
2. Click any bead to jump to that prayer
3. Use prayer buttons to navigate and see corresponding bead highlight
4. Drag the rosary around the screen
5. Switch mystery types to see rosary update

## Future Enhancements
- Mystical shine effects for highlighted beads
- Sound effects for bead interactions
- More detailed cross imagery
- Customizable bead colors and sizes
- Prayer counter integration with bead progression
